# Changelog

## 2026-10-07 — C07 content pipeline

- State packs now have a schema-checked dynamic loader, with JSON-only pack coverage and size budgets. The Contender fairness bot now uses deterministic bot inputs, so it reliably catches a real course-balance regression.

## 2026-10-06 — Roster names

- The six Contenders are Baba Bullabaa, Mr Tiko, Mr Obiliki, Comrade Yale, Mr. Don, and Prof. Sarah. Each one is a role joke with a different face and clothes.

## 2026-10-06 — Campaign map and radio

- Splash and a campaign map show Lagos open now, later states with their Monday dates, and this device's best Crowd. The run HUD names the landmark you are leaving and the one you are heading to.
- Each state has a station. Music is generated in the browser and only the open state's station plays. Èkó Wave is Lagos.

## 2026-10-06 — C04 rides

- Trek and Okada are selectable. Okada unlocks at 150 Following. Result screen shows Foothold, Majority, or Landslide, scaled to the ride.

## 2026-10-06 — Parody names

- AGENTS.md allows parody names. A name or face that is close to a real person is still forbidden. The roster that day was six role names; it was replaced later the same day.

## 2026-10-06 — Lagos pass

- Full-page landscape layout (removed the 480 px portrait column).
- Recycling Lagos road and scenery for the whole course; barricades, tyre heaps, jersey barriers, roadworks, danfo.
- Original stylised characters, 3D studio (turn, top, trousers, footwear), Day 1 Lagos briefing.
- Quieter procedural audio. ADR-0007: no real-person likeness.

## 2026-10-06 — Gate 1

- `feat(c02-c03):` Gate 1 — sim v2 loop, Three.js toon world, UI system, touch, adaptive audio, handoff docs.
- Fix: Trek model crash (`children[4]` OOB) after Contender pick.
- Earlier same-day commits (pre-realign): `feat(c0-c1)` scaffold + sim, `feat(c2-c3)` Zustand/Three stub, `feat(c04)` React shell, `feat(c05)` supporter pickups. Those chunk numbers were provisional; treat this entry as the source of truth for C02/C03.
